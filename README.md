# Video_Classification_and_Tagging

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to classify and tag video segments using the YouTube-8M Segments Dataset. The dataset, which contains millions of labeled video segments from YouTube, offers a vast array of video content spanning a wide variety of categories, including entertainment, education, sports, and more. By applying advanced techniques in deep learning, natural language processing, and video analytics, this project aims to predict the appropriate labels for each video segment, evaluate model performance, and uncover insights about the relationship between video content, metadata, and category labels.

## Key Questions:
1. How accurately can we classify video segments into predefined categories?
2. What features are most important for video classification tasks?
3. How does the model perform across different categories of video content?
4. Can we identify potential biases in the dataset related to overrepresented or underrepresented categories?
5. What are the implications for content recommendation systems and automatic video tagging in platforms like YouTube?

## Data Source:
### YouTube-8M Segments Dataset:
The YouTube-8M dataset consists of a large collection of YouTube video segments, each labeled with one or more of 4,000+ unique video categories. It includes both raw video frames and the corresponding metadata (e.g., labels, video ID, time segments), as well as precomputed features from video frames and audio (e.g., visual and auditory embeddings generated using deep learning models).

## Dataset Details:
Video Segments: Each video is divided into smaller segments, which are labeled with one or more categories.
Labels: Over 4,000 categories representing various domains, such as "sports", "news", "music", "comedy", and more.
Embeddings: The dataset includes preprocessed embeddings for each video segment, which represent the visual and audio features extracted by deep learning models.
Metadata: Additional information, including video duration, metadata like video titles, and time of upload.
